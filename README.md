SciDocSumm
==========

This software summarises scientific documents from citing sentences, that is, sentences from citing papers describing the document to be summarised. It uses lexrank, c-lexrank scores to cluster citing sentences. Further the sentences are matched against rules that describe sentences typical of sections in a scientific document to rerank and select the best to form a summary.
