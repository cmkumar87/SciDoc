Using their knowledge of the distribution of the labels in the data, they set by hand thresholds for the resulting classification.
Abend and Rappoport (2010) distinguish between core and adjunct roles, using an unsupervised parser and part-of-speech tagger.
As baseline, we use two measures used in[1]. Selectional preference is defined as the probability for a head-noun to cooccur with a given (c; v) pair. PMI measures the association between a verb and a case-marker.
semantic role labeling (SRL) and subcategorization acquisition (see Schutze 1995, Schutze & Gibson 1999, Abend & Rappoport 2010, int. al.).
Abend and Rappoport [2010] make their fully unsupervised SRL model by relying on an unsupervised POS induction system [Clark, 2003] and an unsupervised syntactic parser [Seginer, 2007], then building a classifier to discriminate between core and adjunct roles of prepositional arguments. 
Their study employed unsupervised POS tagging and parsing, and measures of selectional preference and argument structure as complementary features for the classifier.
