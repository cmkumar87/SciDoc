This paper proposes a novel approach named CollabRank to collaborative
single-document keyphrase extraction by making use of mutual influences of multiple documents within a cluster context.
CollabRank is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm
to obtain appropriate document clusters, and then using the graph-based ranking algorithm for collaborative single-document
keyphrase extraction within each cluster.
To the best of our knowledge, all previous work conducts the task of keyphrase extraction for each single document independently, without
making use of the collaborative knowledge in multiple documents.
Experimental results demonstrate the good effectiveness of CollabRank.
We also find that the clustering algorithm is important for obtaining the appropriate cluster context and the low-quality clustering results
will deteriorate the extraction performance.
