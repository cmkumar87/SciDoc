Furthermore, CRFs have been used successfully in information extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), named entity recognition (Li and McCallum, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003) and sentence parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
Note that this data is obtained from the articleâ€™s title page itself, and not from any references to source articles, which have been the target of previous studies on CRF-based information extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004; Councill et al. , 2008).
Reported  work includes improved model variants (e.g., Jiao  et al. , 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006), and discourse- level chunking (Feng et al. , 2007).
Statistical machine learning methods such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989; Seymore et al. , 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 1999) and conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al. , 2001; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Sarawagi and Cohen, 2005) have become popular approaches to address the text extraction problem.
Recent work includes improved model variants (e.g. , Jiao et al. , 2006; Okanohara et al. , 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al. , 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).
