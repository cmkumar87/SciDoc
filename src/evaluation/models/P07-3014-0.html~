<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The second approach is to use statistical information about the occurrence of the noun and modifier in a corpus to generate attributes for a machine learning algorithm. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We experiment with three different learning algorithms; Nearest Neighbor, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines (SVM). </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The SVM algorithm produced the best accuracy of all, achieving 50.1% accuracy using the combined set of joining terms. </a>
