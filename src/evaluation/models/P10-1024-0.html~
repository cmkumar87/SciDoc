<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we present a fully unsupervised algorithm for core-adjunct classification. We utilize
leading fully unsupervised grammar induction and POS induction algorithms. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The algorithm uses three measures based on different characterizations of the core-adjunct distinction, and combines them using an ensemble method followed by self-training. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since the semantics of cores is more predicate dependent than the semantics of adjuncts, we expect arguments for which the predicate has a strong preference (in a specific slot) to be cores.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since cores are obligatory, when a predicate persistently appears with an argument in a certain slot, the arguments in this slot tends to be cores. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Adjuncts tend to belong to one of a few specific semantic domains (see Section 2). Therefore, if an argument tends to appear in a certain slot in many of its instances, it is an indication that this argument tends to have a consistent semantic flavor in most of its instances. </a>
