<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Firstly, we wanted to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the task of mapping from a vector of web frequencies of paraphrases containing joining terms to semantic relations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Secondly, we wanted to discover whether the frequency of joining terms was related to their effectiveness at predicting a semantic relation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We compare and evaluate different algorithms and different joining phrases on Nastase and Szpakowiczâ€™s (2003) dataset of 600 modifier-noun compounds.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We find that by using a Support Vector Machine classifier we can obtain better performance on this dataset than a current state-of-the-art system; even with a relatively small set of prepositional joining terms.</a>
