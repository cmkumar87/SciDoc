<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a method for incrementally understanding user utterances whose semantic boundaries are not known and responding in real time even before boundaries are determined. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The method utilizes beam search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper proposed ISSS (incremental significant-utterance-sequence search), an integrated incremental parsing and discourse processing method that enables both the understanding of unsegmented user utterances and real-time responses.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A significant utterance (SU) in the user's speech is a phrase that plays a crucial role in performing the task in the dialogue. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>User utterances are understood by finding a sequence of SUs and updating the belief state based on the sequence. </a>
