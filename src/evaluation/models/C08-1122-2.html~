<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> In this paper, we propose a novel approach named CollabRank for collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction, which makes use of the mutual influences between documents in appropriate cluster context to better evaluate the saliency of words and phrases.  </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Given a document set for keyphrase extraction of each single document, CollabRank first employs the clustering algorithm to group the documents into a few clusters. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Experiments have been performed on a dataset consisting of 308 news articles with human-annotated keyphrases, and the results demonstrate the good effectiveness of the CollabRank approach. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We also find that the extraction performance is positively correlated with the quality of cluster context, and existing clustering algorithms can yield appropriate cluster context for collaborative keyphrase extraction. </a>
