<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One method for deducing semantic relations between words in compounds involves gathering n-gram frequencies of these paraphrases, containing a noun, a modifier and a 'joining term' that links them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Some algorithm can then be used to map from joining term frequencies to semantic relations and so find the correct relation for the compound in question. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The second approach is to use statistical information about the occurrence of the noun and modifier in a corpus to generate attributes for a machine learning algorithm. </a>
<a name="5">[4]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The SVM consistently outperformed the baseline; neither of the other algorithms did so. </a>
