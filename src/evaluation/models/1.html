<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a novel
 approach named CollabRank to collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction by making use of mutual influences\
 of multiple documents within a cluster context.
  </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> CollabRank is implemented by
  first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate
  document clusters, and then using the graph-based \
ranking algorithm for collaborative single-document keyphrase
  extraction within each cluster.
 </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3></a>To the best of our
knowledge, all previous work conducts the task of keyphrase
extraction for each single document independently, without maki\
ng use of the collaborative knowledge in multiple documents.
 </body> 
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4></a>Experimental results
demonstrate the good effectiveness of CollabRank. We also find that
the clustering algorithm is important for obtaining t\
he appropriate cluster context and the low-quality clustering results
will deteriorate the extraction performance.
