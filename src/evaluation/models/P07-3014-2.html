<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Modifier-noun phrases are often used interchangably with paraphrases which contain the modifier and the noun joined by a preposition or simple verb.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For our experiments we used the set of 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The joining terms used for the experiments in this paper were chosen by examining which phrases most commonly occurred between two nouns in the BNC.</a>
<a name="5">[4]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The SVM algorithm produced the best accuracy of all, achieving 50.1% accuracy using the combined set of joining terms. </a>
