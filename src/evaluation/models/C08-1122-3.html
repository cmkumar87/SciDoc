<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> In this paper, we propose a novel approach named CollabRank for collaborative singledocument keyphrase extraction, which makes use of the mutual influences between documents in appropriate cluster context to better evaluate the saliency of words and phrases. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Given a document cluster, CollabRank makes use of the global word relationships in the cluster to evaluate and rank candidate phrases for each single document in the cluster based on the graph-based ranking algorithm. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Experimental results demonstrate the good effectiveness of CollabRank. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We also find that the clustering algorithm is important for obtaining the appropriate cluster context and the low-quality clustering results will deteriorate the extraction performance. </a>
