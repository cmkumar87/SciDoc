<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Abend and Rappoport [2010] make their fully unsupervised SRL model by relying on an unsupervised POS induction system [Clark, 2003] and an unsupervised syntactic parser [Seginer, 2007], then building a classifier to discriminate between core and adjunct roles of prepositional arguments. </a>
