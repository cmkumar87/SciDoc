<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a novel approach named CollabRank to collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction by making use of mutual influences of multiple documents within a cluster context. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> CollabRank is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters, and then using the graph-based ranking algorithm for collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction within each cluster. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To the best of our knowledge, all previous work conducts the task of keyphrase extraction for each single document independently, without making use of the collaborative knowledge in multiple documents.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experimental results demonstrate the good effectiveness of CollabRank. We also find that the clustering algorithm is important for obtaining the appropriate cluster context and the low-quality clustering results will deteriorate the extraction performance. </a>
