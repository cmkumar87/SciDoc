<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One  method for deducing semantic relations between words in compounds involves gathering n-gram frequencies of these paraphrases, containing a noun, a modifier and a “joining term”  that links them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some algorithm can then be used to map from joining term frequencies to semantic relations and so find the correct relation for the compound in question. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We experiment with three different learning algorithms; Nearest  Neighbor, Multi-Layer Perceptron  and Support Vector Machines (SVM). </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We collect web frequencies for queries of the form “head joining term modifier”. </a>
<a name="5">[4]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The SVM  algorithm  produced  the  best  accuracy of all, achieving 50.1%  accuracy using the combined set of joining terms. </a>
