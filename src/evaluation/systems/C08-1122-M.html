<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recently, a resurgence of interest in keyphrase extraction has led to the development of several new systems and techniques for the task (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Turney, 1999; Hulth, 2003; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Hulth, 2004; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Medelyan, 2009; Nguyen and Phan, 2009).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We have based our approach on the previous works done by Wan and Xiao (2008), and Timonen et al.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some methods have been proposed to improve TextRank, of which ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008b; Wan and Xiao, 2008a) uses a small number, namely k, of neighbor documents to 136 provide more information of word relatedness for the construction of word graphs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It has been shown in (Wan and Xiao, 2008a; Wan and Xiao, 2008b) that incorporating these information significantly improves the performance.</a>
