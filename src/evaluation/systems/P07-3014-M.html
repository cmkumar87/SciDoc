<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Nulty (Nulty, 2007) investigated the effectiveness of three different learning algorithms for NC interpretation at the token level.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Nulty (2007) uses a vector-space model representation where the vector coordinates are a fixed set of 28 joining terms like of, for, from, without, across, etc. The values of the coordinates are filled  using Web n-gram frequencies.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Nulty (2007) compares these nearest neighbor models with other machine learning techniques and finds that using a support vector machine leads to improved classification.</a>
