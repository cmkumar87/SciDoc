4.1 Evaluation on Keyphrase Extraction 4.1.1 Performance Comparison and Analysis We use four representative unsupervised methods as baselines for comparison: TFIDF, TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008b) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003).
(Wan and Xiao 2008) propose CollabRank, a similar graph-based ranking model, using the collaborative knowledge given in multiple documents.

During the last decade, many previous works have dealt with the various methods for automatically extracting key phrases (e.g., Frank et al., 1999; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Turney, 2003; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008).
