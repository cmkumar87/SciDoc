Nulty (2007) uses a vector-space model representation where the vector coordinates are a fixed set of 28 joining terms like of, for, from, without, across, etc. The values of the coordinates are filled using Web n-gram frequencies.
Work has been done on detecting relations within noun phrases (Nulty, 2007), named entities (Hirano et al., 2007), clauses (Szpakowicz et al., 1995) and synax-based comma resolution (Srikumar et al., 1995).

There has been work on detecting relations within noun phrases (Moldovan et al., 2004; Nulty, 2007), clauses (Szpakowicz et al., 1995) and syntax-based comma resolution (Srikumar et al., 2008).
