Recently, a resurgence of interest in keyphrase extraction has led to the development of several new systems and techniques for the task (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Turney, 1999; Hulth, 2003; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Hulth, 2004; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Medelyan, 2009; Nguyen and Phan, 2009).
Wan and Xiao (2008) developed a set of 308 documents with up to 10 manually-assigned keywords using newswire documents from DUC 2001.
(Wan and Xiao 2008) propose CollabRank, a similar graph-based ranking model, using the collaborative knowledge given in multiple documents.
During the last decade, many previous works have dealt with the various methods for automatically extracting key phrases (e.g., Frank et al., 1999; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Turney, 2003; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008).
