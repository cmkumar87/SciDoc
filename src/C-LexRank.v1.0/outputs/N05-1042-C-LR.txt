Furthermore, CRFs have been used successfully in information extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), named entity recognition (Li and McCallum, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003) and sentence parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
Statistical machine learning methods such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989; Seymore et al. , 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 1999) and conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al. , 2001; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Sarawagi and Cohen, 2005) have become popular approaches to address the text extraction problem.
