C-Lexrank as explained in (Qazvinian and Radev 2008) receives a list of sentences or documents as input and produces an extractive summary for a given word limit.

It employs Mark Newman's community detection algorithm to maximize the diversity of perspectives.

==========
To run this code, you'll need to install CLAIRLIB (http://clairlib.org); and run the following perl command:

%perl C-LexRank.pl <limit> <input>

Here, <limit> is the summary length in number of sentences, and input is a list file, one document per line.

If you use this code please cite the following paper:

==== Example ====

%perl C-LexRank.pl 5 N05-1042.list 

would generate a summary of 5 sentences in ./outputs/N05-1042-C-LR.txt
and will store intermediate clustering files in ./temp/
