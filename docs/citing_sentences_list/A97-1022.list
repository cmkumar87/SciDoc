The 90's have in fact seen a renewed interest in grammar checking, and proposals have been made for systems covering English (Bernth, 1997) and
other languages such as Italian (Bolioli et al.,1992), Spanish and Greek (Bustamante and Ldon, 1996), Czech (Holan et al., 1997) and Swedish (Hein, 1998).
Among the types of reductions, we consider the reduction by deleting as methodically significant (and related to contextual grammars [16, 4]). 
It allows, in a transparent way, to express some techniques which are (often implicitly) used in development of a grammar-checker for the Czech language [14, 5].
Holan et al. (1997) present a prototype of a grammar checker for the integrated Microsoft Word Czech. The corrector highlights errors spelling and syntax. 
It can also provide a complete list of errors and display the analysis of a sentence as a tree. 
Analyzer morphological discusses the formation of words. Then, the analyzer syntactic trying to create a comprehensive analysis of the sentence with a grammar dependence robust free order (Robust Free Order Dependency Grammar, RFODG, Holan et al., 1997). 
If a problem is detected, the analysis is passed to an evaluation process. Finally, if no analysis can not be obtained, the system does not attempt operation because the results a combination of partial analyzes does not, according to the authors of convincing results.
The advantage of the first approach is the separation of a standard parser and its robust component. That allows to use a standard formalism for the description and implementation of theparser and to develop only a certain kind of mechanism for handling partial parses.
Another possible approach is to try to use similar methods as in grammar-based (not pattern based) grammar-checking. 
In this case we will first try to localize and identify a syntactic error (or,more exactly, the syntactic inconsistency) of the input and then to make some "correction" which will allow to create the required syntactic representation of a particular input sentence. 
In this case the quality of the result to a large extent depends on the accuracy of the error identification, which substantially influences the quality of error-correcting mechanism.
was proposed even for one version of a grammar checker in the early stage of the project LATESLAV [Oliva 93], but it was abandoned later, while the second approach provided a base for a successful implementation of a prototype of a grammar-based grammar checker for Czech (cf. [Holan et al. 97]).
