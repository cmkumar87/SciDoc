It has been shown in (Wan and Xiao, 2008a; Wan and Xiao, 2008b) that incorporating these information significantly improves the performance.
Recently, Wan and Xiao (2008) extracts automatic keyphrases from single documents, utilizing document clustering information.
In the past, various attempts have been made to boost automatic keyphrase extraction performance based primarily on statistics(Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008) and a rich set of heuristic features(Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Medelyan and Witten, Min-Yen Kan Department of Computer Science National University of Singapore kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007).
The study that considers this relevance explicitly is CollabRank proposed by Wan and Xiao (2008).
4.1 Evaluation on Keyphrase Extraction 4.1.1 Performance Comparison and Analysis We use four representative unsupervised methods as baselines for comparison: TFIDF, TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008b) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003).

Wan and Xiao (2008) describe an unsupervised approach called CollabRank that clusters the documents and extracts the keywords within each cluster.
We use Agglomerative (CompleteLink) clustering, which produced the best results for Wan and Xiao (2008).
In the general newswire domain, Wan and Xiao (2008) developed a dataset of 308 documents taken from DUC 2001 which contain up to 10 manually-assigned keyphrases per document.
cohesion between documents and keyphrases (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008); (2) keyphrase cohesion, i.e.
3 KEYWORD EXTRACTION FROM SHORT DOCUMENTS We have based our approach on the previous works done by Wan and Xiao (2008), and Timonen et al.
Wan and Xiao (2008) developed a set of 308 documents with up to 10 manually-assigned keywords using newswire documents from DUC 2001.
Following (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008b), we simply select noun phrases from the given document as candidate keyphrases with the help of POS tags.
In PageRank for keyphrase extraction, the ranking score of a candidate keyphrase p is computed by summing up the ranking scores of all words within the phrase: R(p)=EwiEp R(wi) (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008a; Wan and Xiao, 2008b).
One dataset was built by Wan and Xiao 2 which was used in (Wan and Xiao, 2008b).
During the last decade, many previous works have dealt with the various methods for automatically extracting key phrases (e.g., Frank et al., 1999; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Turney, 2003; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008).
This observation is consistent with the findings reported in (Wan and Xiao, 2008b).
Recently, a resurgence of interest in keyphrase extraction has led to the development of several new systems and techniques for the task (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Turney, 1999; Hulth, 2003; Turney, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Hulth, 2004; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Medelyan, 2009; Nguyen and Phan, 2009).
(Wan and Xiao 2008) propose CollabRank, a similar graph-based ranking model, using the collaborative knowledge given in multiple documents.
We have based our work on CollabRank keyword extraction approach by Wan and Xiao (2008), and feature weighting in short documents by Timonen et al.
(Wan and Xiao 2008) propose CollabRank, a similar graph-based ranking model, using the collaborative knowledge given in multiple documents.
Some methods have been proposed to improve TextRank, of which ExpandRank (Wan and Xiao, 2008b; Wan and Xiao, 2008a) uses a small number, namely k, of neighbor documents to 136 provide more information of word relatedness for the construction of word graphs.
