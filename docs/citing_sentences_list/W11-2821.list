The verbalizer produces an alphabetical glossary with an entry for each named class, property, and individual, without requiring domain dependent generation resources.
The verbalizer actually translates the owl ontology to Prolog, it extracts lexicon entries from owl identifiers and rdfs:label strings, and it uses predetermined sentence plans specified as a dcg grammar.
The swat verbalizer uses a predetermined partial order of statements in each glossary entry; for example, when describing a class, statements about equivalent classes or super-classes are mentioned first, and individuals belonging in the target class are mentioned last.
owl verbalizer of the swat project [158,178], which we found to be particularly robust and useful, as it provides a quick English-like view of an owl domain ontology with no domain authoring effort.
The verbalizer also organizes the English-like sentences of each glossary entry under sub-headings like Definition, Taxonomy, Description, Distinctions.
The natural language names of classes and individuals can be shown as hyperlinks to indicate that they can be used as subsequent targets. 
These systems employ controlled language mechanisms and Natural Language Generation (NLG) technologies such as discourse structures and simple aggregation methods to verbalise Web ontology statements.
During the last decade there has been an increasing interest in developing natural language generators that support Semantic Web such as OWL (Williams,Third and Power 2011).
This increase appears to be motivated by the potential information access to distributed ontology models, the high level semantic specification and the ’common-ground’ input representation to generate.
Many of the existing systems employ verbalisation methods to present the content of the ontology structure to particular subset of users, almost exclusively in English language.
This work was undertaken in the context of the SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring Tool) project, which is investigating the application of NLG/NLP to ontology authoring and editing (Williams et al, 2012).
During the last decade, there has been a shift from developing natural language generation systems to developing generic systems that are capable of producing natural language descriptions directly from Web ontologies (Williams et al., 2011).
we consider the far more restricted issue of how a rhetorical relationship could be assigned to two axioms drawn from an ontology, and hence to the sentences generated from these axioms by an ontology verbaliser,1 using only information that is internal to the ontology.
Results supported our assumption that people using the structured text would judge the tasks easier, although performance was similar on both texts.[12].
One group searched for information in a structured text (see gure 1) the other in an unstructured text (where axioms in the ontology were verbalised as single sentences presented in a long list).
Text organisation was evaluated through a navigation task in which two groups of participants were asked to locate information in texts generated by our system and judge how dicult it was to nd.  
interest in concept-to-text NLG has been revived and several methods have been proposed to express axioms of OWL ontologies (Williams et al., 2011).
We used the owl verbalizer of the swat project (Williams, Third, & Power, 2011), which we found to be particularly robust and useful.
