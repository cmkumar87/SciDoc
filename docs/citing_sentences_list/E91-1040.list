The initial enthusiasm was dampened by a series of critical reviews of the progress in the field by V ́eronis & Ide (1991; 1993a; 1995), who concluded that a fully automatic procedure for the extraction of taxonomies from dictionaries with an acceptable quality was beyond the reach of computational linguistics, at least at its state at the time. 
Their criticism is based on the fact that dictionaries are in practice too inconsistent and unsystematic to lead to a reliable knowledge base.
It should be noted that a good number of the points of criticism by Ide & V ́eronis have to do with the more “advanced” semantic relations and not only to hyperonymy.
Thus combining the outputs P(rlti) from several ti should give a result more accurate than any one in isolation. 
Define the structure of the semantic field, i.e. give the relationships of the members towards other members ([Veronis and Ide, 1991]).
Another possible direction of research is to investigate whether the hypothesis of Veronis et al. that "it is extremely unlikely that the same information is consistently missing from all dictionaries" also holds for synonyms, as about 20 % of the asymmetric synonyms seem to be inconsistencies and oversights on the part of the lexicographers (VERONIS 90, p. 231). 
In this case merging several machine readable dictionaries may correct many of these omissions.
To overcome this bottleneck many researchers have turned to machine readable resources as a possible source for automating the acquisition of a semantic lexicon; various taxonomies of semantic relations have been extracted (VERONIS and IDE 90).
On the other hand, Ide and Veronis (1991, 1993a, 1993b) show that it is very difficult to extract automatically the relations as simple as hyperonymy. 
This is largely due to the inconsistency even 7 dictionaries but also because these dictionaries are primarily designed for needs of men and not for those machines.
[Veronis & Ide 91] provide a quantitative evaluation of the information extracted from several MRDs.
[Veronis & Ide 90] propose a similar method but uses a spreading activation network (see [Hirst 88] and [Hayes 77]) constructed from Collins Dictionary of English Language.
Working on monolingual dictionaries, [Veronis & Ide 91] show that MRDs can be reliable sources of lexical knowledge if we are able to combine information from them.
They provide a quantitative evaluation of the information extracted merging five monolingual MRDs showing that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the extracted dictionary is garbled in some way. 
There is no indication within the network of the nature of the relationships, although the presence of words with important and relatively fixed semantic relations to their headwords in dictionary. definitions is well-known, and much work has been applied to identifying and extracting this information (see Véronis and Ide, 1991).
After a peak of enthusiasm on the field of MRD analysis, interest of the community began to diminish, partly as a consequence of the already mentioned explosion of corpus analysis, but also because of a series of rather pessimistic assessments of the successive efforts (Véronis & Ide 1991;), concluding that a fully automatic procedure for the extraction of semantic information from dictionaries with an acceptable quality was beyond the reach of the computational linguistics of the day.
