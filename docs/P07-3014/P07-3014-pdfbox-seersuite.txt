<abstract>This paper investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to label modifier-noun compounds with a semantic relation. The attributes used as input to the learning algo-rithms are the web frequencies for phrases containing the modifier, noun, and a prepo-sitional joining term. We compare and evaluate different algorithms and different joining phrases on Nastase and Szpako-wiczâ€™s (2003) dataset of 600 modifier-noun compounds. We find that by using a Sup-port Vector Machine classifier we can ob-tain better performance on this dataset than a current state-of-the-art system; even with a relatively small set of prepositional join-ing terms. 1</abstract>
