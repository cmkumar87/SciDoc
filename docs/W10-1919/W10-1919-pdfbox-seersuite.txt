<abstract>Event extraction approaches based on ex-pressive structured representations of ex-tracted information have been a significant focus of research in recent biomedical nat-ural language processing studies. How-ever, event extraction efforts have so far been limited to publication abstracts, with most studies further considering only the specific transcription factor-related subdo-main of molecular biology of the GENIA corpus. To establish the broader relevance of the event extraction approach and pro-posed methods, it is necessary to expand on these constraints. In this study, we pro-pose an adaptation of the event extraction approach to a subdomain related to infec-tious diseases and present analysis and ini-tial experiments on the feasibility of event extraction from domain full text publica-tions. 1</abstract>
