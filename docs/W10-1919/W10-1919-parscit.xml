In adapting the approach to new domains, some extension of the event types is expected to be necessary. By contrast, the argument types and the general design of the representation are intended to be general, and to maintain compatibility with existing systems we aim to avoid modifying these. 2.2 T4SS Domain A corpus of full-text publications relating to the T4SS subdomain of the infectious diseases domain annotated for biological entities and terms of interest to domain experts was recently introduced by (Ananiadou et al., 2010b). In the present study, we use this corpus as a reference standard defining domain information needs. In the following we briefly describe the corpus annotation and the view it provides of the domain. The T4SS corpus annotation covers four classes of tagged entities and terms: Bacteria, Cellular components, Biological Processes, and Molecular functions. The latter three correspond to the three Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) toplevel sub-ontologies, and terms of these types were annotated with reference to both GO and relevance to the interests of domain experts, with guidelines </context>

Finally, systematic errors are made for entities belonging to other categories such as named cell components or species. To address these issues, we applied a domainadapted custom tagger that largely replicates the features of BANNER, further integrating information from the UMLS Metathesaurus,6 which provides a large dictionary containing terms covering 135 different semantic classes, and a custom dictionary of 1081 domain GGP names, compiled by (Ananiadou et al., 2010b). The non-GGP UMLS Metathesaurus terms provided negative indicators for reducing spurious taggings, and the custom dictionary positive indicators. Finally, we augmented the GENETAG training data with 10 copies7 of the training half of the T4SS GGP corpus as in-domain training data. Table 13 shows the results with the domainadapted tagger. We find dramatically improved performance for both abstracts and full texts, showing results competitive with the state of the art performance on GENETAG (Wilbur et al., 2007). Thus, while the performance of an unadapted tagger falls short of both results r</context>

As part of the present study, we introduce annotation for gene/gene product (GGP) mentions (Section 3.2), and in the following discussion of applying an event extraction approach to the domain the availability of this class annotation as an additional category is assumed. 2.3 Adaptation of the Event Model The event model involves two primary categories of representation: physical entities such </context>

The statistics of the annotated 65 events are shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7. For Binding, we find that while an estimated 90% of events involve a GGP argument, the other participant of the binding is in all cases non-GGP, most frequently of Nucleotide type (e.g. NTP/ATP). While only GGP Binding arguments were considered in the shared task events, the argument structures are typical of multi-participant binding and this class of expressions are in scope of the original GENIA Event corpus annotation (Kim et al., 2008). Event annotations could thus potentially be derived from existing data.

Specifically, we chose to study biological processes related to virulence, as these are the most frequent case in the corpus and prototypical of the domain. We adopted the GENIA Event corpus annotation guidelines (Kim et al., 2008), marking associations between specific GGPs and biological processes discussed in the text even when these are stated speculatively or their existence explicitly denied. As the analysis indicated this category of processes to typically involve a single stated participant in a fixed role, annotations were initially recorded as (GGP, process) pairs and later converted into an event representation. During annotation, the number of annotated GGP associations with the targeted class of processes in the T4SS subcorpus was found to be too low to provide material for both training and testing a super</context>

Overall results are microaverages, that is, precision, recall and f-score are calculated from the sum of true positive etc. counts over individual documents. For event extraction, we applied the BioNLP’09 shared task event extraction criteria (Kim et al., 2009) with one key change: to make it possible to evaluate the extraction of the high-level process participants, we removed the requirement that all events must define a Theme as their core argument. 4.3 Gene/Gene Product Tagging The initial GGP tagging results using BANNER are shown in Table 11. We find that even for the relaxed overlap matching criterion, the f-score is nearly 10% points lower than reported on GENETAG in the evaluation on abstracts. For full texts, performance is lower yet by a further 10% points. In both cases, the primary problem is the poor precision of the tagger, indicating</context>

Table 14 shows the results of the applied machine learning-based method contrasted with a co-occurrence baseline replacing the edge detection with a rule that extracts a Cause edge for all trigger-GGP combinations co-occurring within sentence scope. This approach achieves 100% recall as the test data was found to only contain events where the arguments are stated in the same sentence as the trigger. The results show that the machine learning approach achieves very high performance, matching the best results reported for any single event type in the BioNLP’09 shared task (Kim et al., 2009). The very high co-occurrence baseline result suggests that the high performance largely reflects the relative simplicity of the task. With respect to the baseline result, the machine-learning approach achieves a 21% relative reduction in error. While this experiment is limited in both scope and scale, it suggests that the event extraction approach can be beneficially applied to detect domain events represented by novel argument structures.

As the reference tagger, we applied a recent release of BANNER (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) trained on the GENETAG corpus (Tanabe et al., 2005). The corpus is tagged for gene and proteinrelated entities and its texts drawn from a broad selection of PubMed abstracts. The current revision of the tagger3 achieves an f-score of 86.4% on the corpus, competitive with the best result reported in the BioCreative II evaluation (Wilbur et al., 2007), 87.2%.

Briefly, the guidelines specify tagging for minimal continuous spans of specific gene/gene product names, without differentiating between DNA/RNA/protein. A “specific name” is understood to be a a name that allows a domain expert to identify the entry in a relevant database (Entrez gene/Uniprot) that the name refers to. Only GGP names are tagged, excluding descriptive references and the names of related entities such as complexes, families and domains. The annotation was created on the basis of an initial tagging created by augmenting the output of the BANNER tagger (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) by dictionary- and regular expression-based tagging. This initial high-recall markup was then corrected by a human annotator. To confirm that the annotator had correctly identified subdomain GGPs and to check against possible error introduced through the machine-assisted tagging, we performed a further verification of the annotation on approx. 50% of the corpus sentences: we combined the machine- and human-tagged annotations as candidates, removed identifying information, and asked two domain experts to identify the correct GGPs. The two sets of independently produced judgments showed very hi</context>

Although initial agreement was low, for a final set of judgments we measured high agreement, corresponding to 93% f-score when holding one set of judgments as the gold standard. The statistics of the annotation are shown in Table 10. Annotations are sparse in the T4SS subcorpus and, as expected, very dense in the targeted additional data. 4 Experiments 4.1 Methods For GGP tagging experiments, we applied a stateof-the-art tagger with default settings as reference and a custom tagger for adaptation experiments. As the reference tagger, we applied a recent release of BANNER (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008) trained on the GENETAG corpus (Tanabe et al., 2005). The corpus is tagged for gene and proteinrelated entities and its texts drawn from a broad selection of PubMed abstracts. The current revision of the tagger3 achieves an f-score of 86.4% on the corpus, competitive with the best result reported in the BioCreative II evaluation (Wilbur et al., 2007), 87.2%.

We then removed artifacts such as page numbers and running heads and cleaned remaining errors from PDF conversion of the original documents. This selection produced a subcorpus of four full-text documents and 19 abstracts. The statistics for this corpus are shown in Table 8. 3.2 Gene/Gene Product Annotation As gene and gene product entities are central to domain information needs and the core entities of the applied event extraction approach, we first introduced annotation for this entity class. We created manual GGP annotation following the annotation guidelines of the GENIA GGP Corpus (Ohta et al., 2009). As this corpus was the source of the gene/protein entity annotation provided as the basis of the BioNLP shared task on event extraction, adopting its annotation criteria assures compatibility with recently introduced event extraction methods.

A number of recent studies have proposed more expressive representations of extracted information, introducing resources supporting advanced IE approaches (Pyysalo et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010a). A significant step in the development of domain IE methods capable of extracting this class of representations was taken in the BioNLP’09 shared task on event extraction, where 24 teams participated in an IE task setting requiring the extraction of structured representations of multi-participant biological events of several types (Kim et al., 2009). While the introduction of structured event extraction resources and methods has notably advanced the state of the art in biomedical IE representations, the focus of event extraction studies carries other limitations freq</context>
