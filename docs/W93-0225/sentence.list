Furthermore, it has been argued (Moser and Moore, 1993) that many of the intentional relations in RST correspond to different types of dominating intentions in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), e.g. ¡§an RST EVIDENCE relation can occur only when the dominating intention is to affect another¡¦s belief.
These two structures have been characterised as representing what is being talked about (informational) [and] why we are talking about it (intentional) (Moser and Moore, 1993, p.94)
Moser and Moore (1993) also talk about identifying discourse relations through lexical cues.
Hence, Moser and Moore (1993), in their discussion of the relation of intentional and informational structures, considered only monologic discourse believing generalizations between this and multi-agent discourse to be premature(p. 94).
As made clear in Moser & Moore (1993), dominance relations such as these correspond to the direction of intentional relations in RST, i.e. 'the satellite span, S, affects the purpose of the nucleus span, N, only if the intention that S realizes is dominated by the intention that S and N (and possibly others) realize together' (1993: 95).4
Moser and Moore (1993) point out the correspondence between the relation of dominance among intentions in Grosz and Sidner and the nucleussatellite distinction in RST.
In their particular model, informational relations are treated as realisations of intentions, and the authors propose conditioned rules should be found for mapping intentions to informational relations, in as much as there is no isomorphism. (Such work is also adumbrated in Moser & Moore (1993).)
