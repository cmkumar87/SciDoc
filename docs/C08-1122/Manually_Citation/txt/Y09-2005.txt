        Abstract. We propose a new way of generating personalized single document summary by
        combining two complementary methods: collaborative filtering for tag recommendation and
        graph-based affinity propagation. The proposed method, named by Collaborative Summa-
        rization, consists of two steps iteratively repeated until convergence. In the first step, the
        possible tags of one user on a new document are predicted using collaborative filtering which
        bases on tagging histories of all users. The predicted tags of the new document are supposed
        to represent both the key idea of the document itself and the special content of interest to that
        specific user. In the second step, the predicted tags are used to guide graph-based affinity
        propagation algorithm to generate personalized summarization. The generated summary is in
        turn used to fine tune the prediction of tags in the first step. The most intriguing advantage of
        collaborative summarization is that it harvests human intelligence which is in the form of ex-
        isting tag annotations of webpages, such as delicious.com bookmark tags, to tackle a complex
        NLP task which is very difficult for artificial intelligence alone. Experiment on summariza-
        tion of wikipedia documents based on delicious.com bookmark tags shows the potential of
        this method.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we confine personalized document summarization to the extraction from a given
document a few sentence which can best represent the whole content of the document in the point
of view of a given user. While generic document summarization without personalization has been
extensively researched, the trend of personalization is attracting more and more focus since the
outgrowth of the technology of Web 2.0. For example, personalized search engine and personal-
ized e-commence(movies, commodities) recommendation are two successful applications.
   Collaborative filtering is a widely used technology for personalized recommendation. Suppose
some users have rated a set of books, the key idea of collaborative filtering is that similar users
should share similar rating behaviours in the future, where the similarity between users itself is
defined by the similarity of their past rating behaviours. The advantage of collaborative filtering is
that it harvests the computing power of individuals in a population to process the large amount of
complex information. Taking the example of book recommendation, there is no model competitive
with a human brain with regards to understanding a book. We can treat each individual reader as
a super computational power which is reluctant to give feedback. Then the task of collaborative
filtering is to harvest these human power with the least workload on each individual.
   Fortunately, due to the growth of internet and web 2.0 technology, a large amount of tags data
on webpages have been generated by human users. For example, people can tag their favourite

 ?Thanks for all the people who help collecting the dataset.

webpages using the bookmark service of delicious.com and many alike. However, current usage
of tags data is limited to classification of webpages or recommendation of new pages to users. As
far as we know, no attempt has been made to automatically generate a personalized short summary
for a tagged webpage. Instead, users are optionally requested to provide a personal description of
the tagged webpage by hands, which is too much a burden and often leads to copy-and-paste a
whole paragraph in the webpage. In this paper, we focus on automatically generating personalized
summary of a single document for a given user, which has a nature application aforementioned.
Note that multi-document summarization can also benefit from our method with little modification.
   Our method, called Collaborative Summarization, seamlessly combines the state-of-art affinity
propagation based document summarization (Wan and Xiao, 2007) with collaborative filtering
based tag recommendation (Hotho et al., 2006). The combined result is three-fold. First, by
collaborative filtering, we can utilize existing tag information to predict the possible tags of a
new document for a given user, even if the user has not tagged the document. This eliminates
the necessity to annotate a document before summarization, which is a requisite for most existing
summarization methods using side information. Secondly, the predicted tags are a compromise
on the document between community's view and personal view. Thus it is suitable as a guidance
for generating personalized summarization which is supposed to capture both the main content of
the document and the special point of interest of given user. Finally, due to the iterative nature
of collaborative summarization, the generated summary is used to fine tune the predicted tags.
This complements collaborative filtering by incorporating content information into tag prediction,
as collaborative filtering alone only consider the user-tag-document tannery relationship without
considering the actual content of the document.
   In the following sections, we will first introduce the key ideas and notations underlying col-
laborative filtering based tag recommendation and affinity propagation based document summa-
rization. Then we will discuss the detailed algorithms used in our collaborative summarization
method. After that, an experiment on summarize wikipedia articles using delicious.com book-
marks tags is conducted to show the potential of our method. Finally, we will compare some
related work regarding document summarization with side information and conclude our work.

2 Affinity Propagation for Document Summarization

In the work of (Wan and Xiao, 2007) , An affinity graph is built for single or multi-document
summarization, and has shown significant improvement over other graph-based document sum-
marization methods. We will briefly review the key ideas and notations while focusing on single
document summarization.
   Suppose we have a document consisting of n sentences {S1,S2, · · · ,Sn}. Each sentence is
presented by a vector ~s of tft  isft value of each term t, where tft is the number of term t in that
sentence and isft is inverse sentence frequency calculated by

                                                            N
                                          isft = 1 + log                                           (1)
                                                            nt

where N is the total number of sentences in the background corpus and nt is the total number of
sentence containing term t.
   We can construct a directed graph on all the sentences by defining a similarity measurement of
each pair of sentences, namely sentence affinity:


                                         Aff(si,sj) =   ~si · ~sj                                  (2)
                                                        k~sik
   Sentence affinity is a measurement of semantic similarity between sentences and it's not sym-
metric as opposed to cosine similarity. The affinity graph can be constructed by linking two


                                                 475

sentence nodes whenever the affinity value between them is not zero. Usually the affinity scores
associated with each sentence are normalized, however, it's not always a necessity.
   After the affinity graphed is built, a page-rank like algorithm is applied to the graph to calcu-
late a score for each sentence node, which is called information richness of that sentence. The
justification is intuitive: The more neighbours a sentence has, the more informative it is; and the
more informative a sentence's neighbours are, the more informative it is. Thus a iterative update
is straightforward:


              info(si) = dampfactor ·
                                        j6=iS
                                         X      info(sj) · aff(sj,si) + 1 - dampfactor            (3)
                                                                               N

where a damp factor is used to speed up the convergence.
   Finally, when converged, the information richness scores of all sentences are sorted, and sen-
tences with the largest scores are picked as summarization for the document. Some redundancy
removal methods can be used for post-processing.

3 Collaborative Filtering based Tag Recommendation

Recently, tag recommendation in online social network has attracted increasing attention, and
even a new word named folksonomy is dedicated to the concept. In this section, we will focus on
collaborative filtering based tag recommendation since it has a natural relationship with affinity
propagation based document summarization, as will be discussed below.
   Suppose we have a set of users U assigning various tags T onto a set of documents D. All
the useful information can be described by a ternary relationship (U,T,D). For example, an
instantiation from the relationship (u,t,d) means that user u assigned tag t to document d. We
denote the set of tag assignments to be Y .
   A widely referenced collaborative filtering based tag recommendation, called FolkRank (Hotho
et al., 2006), makes recommendations based on a tripartite graph built from such ternary relation-
ship. We denote the tripartite graph by G = (V,E). The graph nodes V are combination of all
users, tags and documents,i.e. V = U  T  D. The edge in the tripartite graph connects two
entities(user, tag or document) if both entities occur in a tag assignment and the weight of the edge
amounts to the count of their co-occurrences.
   More specifically, the weight of an edge connecting tag t and document d is defined by

                                w(t,r) = |{u  U : (u,t,d)  Y }|                                 (4)

And similarly,
                                w(t,u) = |{d  D : (u,t,d)  Y }|                                 (5)

                                w(u,d) = |{t  T : (u,t,d)  Y }|                                 (6)

   FolkRank applies personalized pagerank on the constructed graph G twice:

                                       w = G~w + (1 - )p~
                                       ~                                                          (7)

where w is a score vector over all graph nodes, corresponding to the information richness vector in~
affinity graph. p~ is the personalization vector over all graph nodes(usually only the tag nodes) per
user. The value of p~ can be chosen at will as long as higher value at a node indicates higher impor-
tance. We will formulate this vector latter in equation 10.  is a tradeoff parameter determining
the influence of personalization vector.
   In the first step,  is set to 1; while in the second step,  is set to a value in [0, 1]. The final
score vector is
                                         w = w< - w
                                         ~     ~   1    ~  =1                                     (8)


                                                 476

Tags with the highest scores are selected for recommendations.
    Note that many improvement and variations (Abel et al., 2008; Abel et al., 2009a; Abel et al.,
2009b) have been proposed since the publication of FolkRank. However, we'll focus on the naive
FolkRank for the sake of simplicity since our main concern is the fusion of the two methods. After
all, various improvement can also be applied to our method to achieve even better result.

4 Collaborative Summarization

As we can see from section 2 and section 3, the key ideas underlying Affinity Propagation based
document summarization and Collaborative Filtering based tag recommendation are quite similar.
This motivates our method to seamlessly fuse them together.

4.1 A Real Motivating Example

Before diving into the details of our method, let's first show an example on why we need to fuse
the two methods mentioned above.
    Here is a random bookmark selected from www.delicious.com. It is a wikipedia article about
                                      1

Satisficing, which is decision-making strategy taking account of human limitations to pursue a
near-optimal result. Three different users who have tagged at least three tags are listed below .
                                                                                                2


      User A economics , theory , psychology , wikipedia , language , reference , work

      User B psychology , strategy , usability , decisionmaking , satisficing , herbertsimon

      User C article , economics , markets , theory

As we can see, user A makes a fairly comprehensive tagging of the article with three different em-
phases such as economics, psychology and language. Meanwhile, user B seems more concerned
with psychology issue of this article while user C cares more about its economics implication.
    Clearly, a summary of this article taking account of tags made by all users, as in the case of
naive tag oriented document summarization, totally ignores these different interest of users. On
the other hands, collaborative filtering based tag recommendation can provide a personalized tag
prediction. That is to say, even if a user makes no tag on this article at all, we can still predict
his/her interest point on this article by using the tagging history of that user and all others users.
However, collaborative filtering totally ignores the actual content of this article(only uses tags
information), which is the very concern of document summarization.
    Thus, it's a natural thought that we can use collaborative filtering based tag recommendation to
introduce personalized side information into document summarization. In retrospect, we can also
improve collaborative filtering based tag recommendation by utilizing the summary information
of an article.

4.2 Fusion of the Two Methods

Fortunately, the similar principle underlying both collaborative filtering based tag recommendation
and affinity propagation based document summarization provides a natural basis to build a hyper
algorithm. The idea is to build a hyper graph combining four factors: users, tags, documents and
sentences.
    With affinity propagation, we already have an affinity graph on all sentences of an article. With
collaborative filtering, we already have a tripartite graph between users, tags and documents. The
missing part is a graph connecting tags and sentences in a given article. As seen in Figure 1.
    Here we first define a similarity between a tag t and a sentence s by mutual information:

                                                                   P(t,w)
                                sim(t,s) =
                                             termws
                                                X        P(t,w)log                                (9)
                                                                   P(t)P(w)

                       Users                       Tags                     Documents




                                                  Sentences



Figure 1: Hyper graph combining users, tags , documents and sentences. The tripartite sub-graph in the
upper half is built by collaborative filtering based tag recommendation model, the inter-sentence graph in
the lower half is built using affinity propagation model. The edges connecting tags and sentences bridge the
upper half and lower half. (Edges between users and documents are not drawn for clarification)


where P(t,w) is the probability that tag t and term w occurs together in one article in the back-
ground corpus. P(t) is the probability of observing tag t, which can be calculated by dividing the
count of tag t by the total count of all tags. P(w) is the probability of observing term w in the
background corpus, which can be calculated by dividing the count of sentence containing term w
by the total count of sentences in the background corpus. A similar definition can be found in the
work of (Markines et al., 2009).
   Now we can draw an undirected edge between each pair of tag and sentence. Note that we can
normalize the similarity per tag or per sentence, which will make the similarity not symmetric.
Moreover, we can threshold the similarity and only connect a pair of tag and sentence only if the
similarity between them is above a certain value.
   The remaining problem is how to incorporate the new edge into two original graphs. As for
the tripartite graph of collaborative filtering, we can achieve this by adjusting the personalization
vector in equation 7. Suppose the information richness scores of sentences are already known, the
personalization vector can be constructed by

                           p~(t) = d  Xinfo    (s)  sim(t,s) + (1 - d)  p (t)
                                                                            ~                        (10)
                                       sS
where p (t) is the initial value for p~(t). d is damp-factor controlling the influence of initial values.
       ~
It has no influence on the final result except the convergence rate. We will use the same damp-
factor throughout the paper. From the equation, we can see that, the more informative sentences a



                                                    478

tag connects to, the more informative the tag is.
   An importance issue with equation 10 is how to decide the values of p (t). As our candidate
                                                                                  ~
set of tags for a pair of user and document is the set of all tags, if the user has not assigned any tag
to the document, we assign an equally large weight to the most possible tags and a small weight
to all other tags. Following (Hotho et al., 2006), we assign a weight of |T| to all the tags used by
the user and all the tags associated to the document, and assign 1 to all other tags, then normalize
the weights to sum to 1. If the user has already tagged the document, we further multiply a factor
of |T| to user's tags then normalize. Generally, this will lead to different initial values of p~ for
different users, in the hope to represent the users' taste.
   Next, turning to sentence affinity graph, we can incorporate tag information by attaching a
personalization value ~q(s) to each sentence s. This personalization vector can be updated similarly
to p~

                           ~q(s) = d   Xw    ~(t)  sim(t,s) + (1 - d)  q (s)
                                                                            ~                         (11)
                                        tT
where w is the score vector from equation 8.~

    With modified affinity updating equation, the more important tags a sentence associated with,
the more informative it becomes.
    Until now, two sub-graphs induced by collaborative filtering and affinity propagation are con-
nected together. A pagerank like algorithm can be applied to this hyper graph. To summarize,
collaborative summarization following the procedure above to generate summarization.
    We emphasize that this algorithm is based on naive Folkrank for tag recommendation, and
various improvement over Folkrank can also be applied here to get a better p~ which we leave for
practical implementation.

5 Experimentation

In this section, we design an experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative sum-
marization (CS) method. Two questions are addressed:(1) How much advantage does CS have
compared with tag-based and content-based document summarization. (2) Can CS improve tag
recommendation as well?
    Although there are large amount of social tagging and bookmark resource on the internet,
no standard summarization result for them exists, let alone personalized summary for a given
document. Thus, we download a total of 100 English wikipedia articles from en.wikipedia.com as
our document summarization dataset. Then we collect 1084 users' tagging data on 5000 wikipedia
articles and a total of 8396 different tags from online bookmark site www.delicious.com. We select
10 active delicious.com users from the 1084 users, and let them extract the top-5 sentences from
the 100 wikipedia articles dataset as the personalized summarization for the articles. Note that we
don't require the selected users to tag the articles.
    ROUGE-1 is used to evalute the effectiveness of the proposed method. We compare Collabora-
tive Summarization(CS) to three other summarization methods: (1) Open Text Summarizer (OTS) 3

which only scores each sentence without considering tags. (2) Affinity Propagation based sum-
marization (AP) which is a graph-based method not considering tags. (3) EigenTag which uses all
the tags assigned to a document without personalization. The result is shown in Table 1, which
indicates significant improvement over all measurements.
    All the dampfactor in Collaborative Summarization is set to 0.5, as it has nothing to do with
final result. We set  = 0.8 in the second step of Folkrank. The influence parameter in equation 7
is set to 0.95. The parameter d in equation 10 is set to 0.2. As for EigenTag, the parameter  is set
to 0.95 as the author advised.
    For Affinity Propagation and Collaborative Summarization methods, redundancy removal is
conducted in the post-process stage. Since the AP and CS share the same affinity measurement
between sentences, we adopt the same redundancy removal technology as in Affinity Propagation.
The idea is that we pick the most information-rich sentence out and penalize its neighbours to
promote diversity, then repeat this process to generate a list of sentences. Readers are referred to
(Wan and Xiao, 2007) for more details.

The result is evaluated using standard precision and recall as shown in Table 2. It indicates that
the fusion of both methods benefit each other.

6 Related Work

In this section, we describe the relationship between our method and other approaches in both
graph-based document summarization and tag recommendation. The contexts of these two topics
are too rich to cover up here, so we only focus on graph-based approaches.

6.1 Graph based Document Summarization

Graph based document summarization methods have been proposed for both single and mult-
document summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mani and Bloedorn, 2000; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2005). Many of them are based on PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) or HITS (Kleinberg, 1999).
   One advantage of graph-based document summarization methods is that it can easily incor-
porate various side information, such as user profile, user query (Saggion et al., 2003; Ge et al.,
2003; Conroy and Schlesinger, 2005) and specific topic (Farzindar et al., 2005). However, there
are two issues with most existing user/query/topic-oriented document summarization. First, cur-
rent graph-based methods usually focus on given single or multiple documents to generate sum-
marization while ignoring all other documents in the corpus, which seems rather reasonable at the
first glance. However, the information or regularity contained in the whole corpus of document
can serve as a common sense for the summarization of specific documents. It has been shown in
(Wan and Xiao, 2008a; Wan and Xiao, 2008b) that incorporating these information significantly
improves the performance. Our method is also along this line of thinking but following a different
direction, i.e. by incorporating the wisdom of the population of people rather than documents.
   Secondly, most existing document summarization methods using side information post a heavy
burden on users. A user either has to specify his/her profile or topic of interest (Zhang et al., 2003),
or has to first tag a document (Zhu et al., 2009) in order to receive a personalized summarization.
The issue is most obvious in the scenario that a user needs personalized summarization of a totally
new document, which is often the case in real life. As far as we know, no effort has been made
to passively mining user's point of interest to provide a personalized summarization. Our work,
using ideas from collaborative filtering, may shed some light in this direction of research.

6.2 Tag Recommendation

Tag recommendation embraces a broad range of objects including document, image, video and so
on. Since the content to be tagged varies a lot across different applications, collaborative filter-
ing based tag recommendation has an appealing advantage that it is content independent. After
Folkrank was proposed for solving the problem, a lot of refinement (Wu et al., 2006) is made to
incorporate more useful information, such as the concept of groups of tags (Abel et al., 2008).
However, when facing the problem of document summarization, we need to further incorporate
the information from document content. Our method provides one seamless way to do so while
some related work (Tso-Sutter et al., 2008) follows other directions.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we argue that single document summarization can be significantly improved by
harvesting human computing power made available by the rapid out-growth of internet technology.
There is no surprise that population of human brains can and will complement most existing
language models and algorithms in complex NLP tasks for a long time. The philosophy implied
here definitely has a larger range of application than document summarization. For example,
active learning in machine learning literature shares the same characteristics involving an optimal
collaboration between machines and users.
   More specifically, by combining collaborative filtering and affinity propagation together, we
show that we can make personalized summarization for a given user even on a totally new doc-
ument for that user. Thus, the proposed method reduces the burden of user in a personalized
summarization system. Moreover, the side information contained in tags presents both the general
meaning and personal interest of the document. Incorporating such side information is shown to
boost the performance significantly.
