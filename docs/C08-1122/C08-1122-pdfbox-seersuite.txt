<abstract>Previous methods usually conduct the keyphrase extraction task for single docu-ments separately without interactions for each document, under the assumption that the documents are considered inde-pendent of each other. This paper pro-poses a novel approach named Col-labRank to collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction by making use of mutual influences of multiple documents within a cluster context. CollabRank is implemented by first employing the clus-tering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters, and then using the graph-based ranking algorithm for col-laborative single-document keyphrase ex-traction within each cluster. Experimental results demonstrate the encouraging per-formance of the proposed approach. Dif-ferent clustering algorithms have been investigated and we find that the system performance relies positively on the qual-ity of document clusters. 1</abstract>
